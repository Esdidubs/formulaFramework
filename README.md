# Formula.js Framework

[Live Page](https://esdidubs.github.io/formulaFramework/)

The purpose of this project was to make a JavaScript framework that could be used for any math-based web projects. Once the framework was built, I created a mock website showing how the framework could be easily used in a project.


## Features
- 23 math formulas accessible using methods
- 5 methods on the prototype for easy use
